# CodeWay-ML-Internship 

Welcome to the repository for my machine learning internship  at Codeway!

Task-1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
-Creating a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. We
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.

Task-2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
-Building a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

DATA SET LINK:

Task-3: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
-Developing a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based
service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like
usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like
Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict
churn.

Task-4: SPAM SMS DETECTION
-Building an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like 
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.

Task-5: HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION
-Implementing a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate
handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of handwritten text
examples, and let it generate new text based on the learned patterns.
